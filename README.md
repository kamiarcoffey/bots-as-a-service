### Project Description

Our project deals with a bot creation and maintenance service that will provide a GUI to allow users to administer their bots as well as hosting created bots in the cloud.

Our first iteration will deal only with reddit bots and will only allow modular functionality, with the potential to allow for other services like Twitter as well as the potential to allow for custom actions to be taken by the bot.
