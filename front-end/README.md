# front-end

This GUI is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is deployed and served via TBD.

Read also the generated [`README.md`](react-portal/README.md).

## Development

To run this in development mode, make sure you have `npm` installed.

You can pull this repo and simply run:

```shell
cd react-portal
npm install
npm start
````

to have the service listen on `:3000`.

`npm` development mode will also re-compile files when a save that includes a change is performed.
